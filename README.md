# LunarLander-v3-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Agent
Developed and trained a deep reinforcement learning agent using the PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines3 to solve the LunarLander-v3 environment (OpenAI Gymnasium). The project features:

• Custom neural network policy architecture and adaptive learning rate.
• Automated training, checkpointing, and export of model weights in a portable NumPy format.
• Modular evaluation pipeline with dynamic policy loading and batch testing.

This project demonstrates practical skills in RL, PyTorch, and reproducible AI workflows.
